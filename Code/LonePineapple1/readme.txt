Future improvements to be made:
	Add support for the MPU-9250 IMU that's on the board, using Invensense's proprietary AHRS filter code.  Goal of this is to add a navball indicator oerlay to pictures taken with cameras on the upper train.  A file can be found in the "Developement Code" folder that has a working quaternion filter, but it's hacked together and is not that great.  Invensense's code has a precompiled , meaning that the code for the Pineapple board will have to be compiled outside the Arduino environment using a makefile or something.  Unless Arduino adds support for those.  But makefile compilation is a good goal anyway.  Much better coding practice.
